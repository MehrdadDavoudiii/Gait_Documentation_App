Gait Documentation System - Help Guide

This application lets you record and manage patient information,
examinations, interventions, and associated files in an organised,
centralised database.  The main window lists all patients and
provides quick access to common tasks.

Adding a new patient:
 • Click the "Add New Patient" button at the bottom of the main window to
   open a form where you can enter the patient's demographic details.
   Fields marked with an asterisk are required.  Optional information
   such as address and contact details can be recorded as well.

Searching for patients:
 • Use the drop‑down box at the top of the patient list to choose a search
   field (last name, diagnosis, patient ID or zip code).  Type into
   the adjacent search box to filter the patient list dynamically.
 • You can also restrict the birth date range using the date pickers.

Editing or deleting a patient:
 • Select a patient in the list and click "Edit Selected Patient" to open a
   form where you can modify their details.  The Save and Cancel buttons
   appear at the bottom of the form.
 • Click "Delete Selected Patient" to remove a patient and all associated
   examinations, interventions and attachments.  You will be asked to
   confirm before the record is permanently deleted.

Recording examinations and interventions:
 • Double‑click a patient in the list to open their detail window.  This
   window contains tabs for examinations, interventions and a combined
   timeline.
 • In the examinations tab, fill in the form at the top and click
   "Add Exam" to record a new entry.  The date pickers allow you to
   specify the exam date; height and weight (if provided) will be used
   to calculate BMI automatically.
 • The interventions tab works similarly, with a separate form and
   "Add Intervention" button.

Working with attachments:
 • Each exam or intervention can have files attached (for example
   reports, images or videos).  Double‑click an entry in the list to
   open the attachments manager.
 • Use the "Add Attachment..." button to browse for a file.  A copy of
   the selected file will be stored in the application’s local
   attachments folder so that it remains accessible even if the original
   file is moved or deleted.
 • Double‑click a file in the attachments list to open it with the
   default application on your system.

Timeline view:
 • The timeline tab displays both examinations and interventions
   chronologically, along with the patient's age at each event.  This
   view helps you see the sequence of care over time.

Backup and data storage:
 • The application uses a local SQLite database ("health_records.db")
   stored Users\...\AppData\Local\GaitDocumentationSystem. Your attachments are
   saved in a subfolder named "attachments" next to the database.
